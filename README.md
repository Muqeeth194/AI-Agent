# AI Assistant to Generate Full Stack Applications

## Overview

This is a terminal-based AI Agent designed as a powerful, conversational assistant specializing in generating full stack applications through efficient and effective resolution of user queries. It interacts with users step-by-step by analyzing, planning, and executing actions using a variety of tools to deliver accurate and helpful responses.

## Features

## How It Works

The assistant operates based on a start, plan, action, observe workflow:

1. **Start:** Receives the user query and interprets the goal
2. **Plan:** Develops a step-by-step plan based on the capabilities and context
3. **Action:** Executes the planned steps by calling integrated tools
4. **Observe:** Reviews the results of each action and adjusts accordingly
5. **Output:** Delivers the final response or asks clarifying questions if necessary
